This table represents the coefficients estimated from a logistic regression model. Each row corresponds to a predictor variable (in this case, different political parties), and the columns provide information about the estimated coefficients, standard errors, z-values, and p-values associated with each predictor.

Estimate: The estimated coefficient represents the log-odds ratio or the change in the log-odds of the outcome variable (in this case, the likelihood of discussing the EU) associated with a one-unit change in the predictor variable. For example, for "partyChange UK," the estimated coefficient of 1.1879 suggests that being affiliated with the "Change UK" party is associated with an increase of approximately 1.1879 in the log-odds of discussing the EU compared to the reference category.
